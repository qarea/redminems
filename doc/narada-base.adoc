Narada base
===========

This project was created using https://github.com/powerman/narada-base
(template for new projects designed for Narada framework).

This document describe how to use files provided by this template.


== Setup

=== ./build [-h|--help] [-t|--test]

You usually should edit it to set commands used to build and test your
project.

Default implementation will compile and install Go commands into `bin/`.

Also you may need to change commands used to run build-time tests if your
project doesn't use http://testanything.org/[TAP]-compatible tests in
`t/**/*.t` and/or `bin/*.t` files.

Run with `-t|--test` to enable build-time tests.

=== ./release [-h|--help|-n|--major|--minor|--patch|<version>]

You usually should edit it to set commands needed to release your project.

Default implementation will generate patch file with differences since
previous released version for all files in your project repo (except
files listed in `.releaseignore`) and tgz file with compiled binaries
(`bin/*`).

Generated files will be saved into `.release/` subdirectory. You can
remove files you don't need anymore. You can re-generate files for any
commit by running `git checkout <commit>; ./release`.

NOTE: Re-generated files may differ from original ones, for ex. in case
different compiler was used or build date was embedded in generated files
or generated files was manually changed (this may happens in advanced
cases when you join two branches of project).

Run with `-n` to disable build-time tests.

=== ./deploy [-n] [<version>]

You usually should edit it to set commands needed to deploy your project.

Default implementation will deploy your project into `_live/` subdirectory
and suitable only for local testing while development.

Also you may need to change commands used to run tests after deploy if
your project doesn't use http://testanything.org/[TAP]-compatible tests in
`t/**/*.t` files.

Run with `-n` to disable deploy-time tests.

=== ./deploy_server [<version>]

You should edit it to set `addr` (SSH account on remote server) and `path`
(project's directory on remove server) variables.

Default implementation will upload and install/upgrade project on remote
server using ssh.

=== migrate

Before you'll `./release` first version you can edit it to change files
which will be created in directory where you deploy your project by first
release (this isn't required, you always can change them later in next
releases). Here is some changes you may like to do:

- `config/mysql/` and `var/mysql/`: you may like to remove it if your
  project doesn't use MySQL
- `config/qmail/` and `var/qmail/`: you may like to remove it if your
  project doesn't use `~/.qmail*` to handle incoming emails
- `config/crontab/backup`:
  * make sure default backup schedule (daily incremental backups, new full
    backup every week) is suitable for you or change it
  * replace `echo Reminder: ...` with real command used to (recommended)
    encrypt or compress and upload your backup somewhere, for example:
+
[source,sh]
----
narada-backup &&
rm -f var/backup/full.tar.gpg &&
gpg --s2k-count 1000000 --batch --cipher-algo AES256 -c \
    --passphrase-file config/backup/pass var/backup/full.tar &&
scp var/backup/full.tar.gpg USER@HOST:PATH/`date +"%Y%m%d-%H%M%S"`.full.gpg
----


== Usage

While developing new version of your project you should add any extra
upgrade/downgrade operations needed to migrate between previous and new
versions into `migrate` file. Default operations like copying binary files
or patching text files will be automatically added into `migrate` when
you'll run `./release`, but there are may be some extra operations which
you'll have to add manually, like:

- create/modify/remove config/data files or directories in project's
  deploy directory
- change database scheme
- convert data in database
- restart background processes/services affected by these changes

NOTE: When you're doing `git merge` or `git cherry-pick` you usually
should not modify part of `migrate` files which was already included in
previous releases - you can make changes only after latest `VERSION` line.
This restriction doesn't apply to `git rebase` or in case when you're
fixing wrong downgrade operations for already released version.

You can run `./build` or `./build --test` at any time just to make sure
your project builds ok and pass build-time tests.

You can run `./release && ./deploy` at any time (even when you've not
committed yet changes in work directory) to release and deploy into
`_live/` current project to check how it works before committing changes
into repository.

When you're ready to release current HEAD and tag it as new version you
should run `./release --major|--minor|--patch|<version>`.

To deploy one of already released versions into `_live/` you can run
`./deploy [<version>]`.

To deploy some version on remote server copy `.release/*` files related to
that version into `.release/` subdirectory of project's deploy directory
on server and then run `narada-install <version>` in project's deploy
directory on server. If you're using SSH to access your server then you
can just run `./deploy_server [<version>]`.

If you'll add TAP-compatible tests into `t/build/` then they'll be
automatically executed by `./build --test` in work directory. If you'll
add TAP-compatible tests into `t/devel/` then they'll be automatically
executed by `./deploy` in deploy (`_live/`) directory.


== Advanced usage

=== Joining multiple upgrades into one

If you've released 50 versions from 1.0.0 to 1.50.0 then it may took to
much time to deploy your project on new server because `narada-install`
doing this step by step, version by versionâ€¦ plus generate 49 useless
backups. In this case you would like to prepare alternative release for
version 1.50.0 which you'll be able to deploy on new server in single
step. Here is how to do this (the `<from>` is 1.0.0 and `<to>` is 1.50.0
for this example):

----
git checkout <to>
git reset --soft <from>
----

Next, modify `migrate` file by removing all `INSTALL` and `VERSION ...` lines after
`VERSION <from>` (do not remove this one). You also may need other changes
to make sure all migrate operations after that line will correctly migrate
between `<from>` and `<to>`. Then:

----
git add migrate
git commit -m 'combined upgrade <from>-<to>'
./release <from>-<to>
echo -ne 'VERSION <to>\n\n' >> .release/<from>-<to>.migrate
echo -ne 'VERSION <to>\n\n' >> migrate
----

TODO Few more actions are needed to complete this (modified migrate files
should be added to the repo into the last commit, this modified commit
should be re-tagged and force-pushed to origin repo).

=== Merging different project versions

If you've stable project branch with versions 1.x and unstable branch with
versions 2.x, and you wanna provide upgrade path from version 1.50.0 to
version 2.8.0, then you'll need to prepare alternative release for version
2.8.0 (existing one will upgrade from 2.7.0). Here is how to do this (the
`<from>` is 1.50.0 and `<to>` is 2.8.0 for this example):

----
git checkout <from>
git merge <to>
----

Next, resolve conflict on `migrate` file: it must be same as it was in
`<from>` with appended operations needed to migrate between `<from>` and
`<to>`.

Chances are this won't be ease, you may need to develop new tools for data
migrations, and as result contents of deploy directory may not match
original `<to>` version. In this case you'll have to release intermediate
version first:

----
git add .
git commit -m 'merge upgrade <from>-<to>-pre'
./release <from>-<to>-pre
----

Then act similar to "Joining multiple upgrades into one" case but keep
current `migrate`:

----
git checkout <to>
git reset --soft <from>-<to>-pre
git checkout <from>-<to>-pre migrate
git add migrate
git commit -m 'merge upgrade <from>-<to>'
./release <from>-<to>
echo -ne 'VERSION <to>\n\n' >> .release/<from>-<to>.migrate
----
