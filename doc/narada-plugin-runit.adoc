Narada plugin: runit
====================

This project was created using https://github.com/powerman/narada-plugin-runit
(plugin for template for new projects designed for Narada framework).

This document describe how to use files provided by this plugin.


== Dependencies

You should have http://smarden.org/runit/[runit] installed (either
system-wide or in your home directory with binaries available in `$PATH`).


== Usage

Just create `./service/` directory with subdirectories for each service,
and put there executable `run` and (optional) `log/run` files for these
services. All services will be automatically started, and you can then
control them using `sv <COMMAND> ./service/<SERVICE>` in project's root
directory. For more documentation see runit website or man pages for
sv(8), runsv(8) and runsvdir(8).

You can see example of such service in
https://github.com/powerman/narada-plugin-socklog/tree/master[narada-plugin-socklog].
