Narada plugin: socklog
======================

This project was created using https://github.com/powerman/narada-plugin-socklog
(plugin for template for new projects designed for Narada framework).

This document describe how to use files provided by this plugin.


== Dependencies

You should have http://smarden.org/socklog/[socklog] installed (either
system-wide or in your home directory with binaries available in `$PATH`).

Require https://github.com/powerman/narada-plugin-runit[Narada plugin
runit].


== Usage

Configure all applications in your project to send their logs to syslog,
using UNIX socket `var/lock.sock` instead of default `/dev/log` (required
configuration changes are in plugin's `migrate` file).

Use `var/log/config` to configure
http://smarden.org/runit/svlogd.8.html[svlogd(8)] (log size, rotation,
filtering, etc.).

You can store different messages in different log files. To implement this
you should create several subdirectories in `var/log/` with
`var/log/*/config` files, to define which messages should be stored in
each log directory, and restart log/log service with
`sv t ./service/log/log/`.
